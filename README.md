# Drop2 - A LibGDX Rain Catching Game

Drop2 is a fast-paced arcade game developed with the LibGDX framework in Java.
The objective is to control a bucket and catch as many falling raindrops as possible before time runs out.
Featuring a responsive main menu, customizable sound and music settings, a pause menu, randomized raindrop speed, and a persistent high score system, Drop2 demonstrates proficiency in game development, UI design, and state management using Gradle and the new LWJGL3 backend.
